# VBA-Excel-Eliquid
A fun little project I created for myself to use as an offline alternative to other available e-liquid apps.<br/>
I've included the VBA code separately from the Excel file for presentation's sake, but if you want to use this, you only need **E-liquid.xlsm**.<br/>
I've included a small video demo below.<br />
